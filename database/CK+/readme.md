The Extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) database distribution: PHASE 1
Initial: 1st July 2010
Revised: 28th Sept 2010
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this Phase there are 4 zipped up files. They relate to:

1) The Images (cohn-kanade-images.zip) -  there are 593 sequences across 123 subjects which are FACS coded at the peak frame. All sequences are from the neutral face to the peak expression.

2) The Landmarks (Landmarks.zip) - All sequences are AAM tracked with 68points landmarks for each image. 

3) The FACS coded files (FACS_labels.zip) - for each sequence (593) there is only 1 FACS file, which is the last frame (the peak frame). Each line of the file corresponds to a specific AU and then the intensity. An example is given below.

4) The Emotion coded files (Emotion_labels.zip) - ONLY 327 of the 593 sequences have emotion sequences. This is because these are the only ones the fit the prototypic definition. Like the FACS files, there is only 1 Emotion file for each sequence which is the last frame (the peak frame). There should be only one entry and the number will range from 0-7 (i.e. 0=neutral, 1=anger, 2=contempt, 3=disgust, 4=fear, 5=happy, 6=sadness, 7=surprise). N.B there is only 327 files- IF THERE IS NO FILE IT MEANS THAT THERE IS NO EMOTION LABEL (sorry to be explicit but this will avoid confusion).


Examples:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All file name and structure should be the same. For example, an image
at:

cohn-kanade-images/S005/001/S005_001_00000011.png
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
will have the corresponding landmark at:

Landmarks/S005/001/S005_001_00000011_landmarks.txt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FACS code at:

FACS/S005/001/S0005_001_00000011_facs.txt

which has

9.0000000e+00 Â Â 4.0000000e+00
1.7000000e+01 Â Â 2.0000000e+00

this means that AU9d and AU17b are present
N.B if an AU is present but the intensity is 0 this means that the
intensity was not given

e.g.

1.20000000e+00 0.000000000e+00

just means AU12 (intensity not given).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Emotion code at:

Emotion/S005/001/S005_001_00000011_emotion.txt

which has
3.00000000e+00

that is disgust

Soon we will release Phase 2 which will contain the non-posed smiles portion of the dataset. Phase 3 will contain the non-frontal synchronous data. Please see website for updates.
